1. Introduction

The Mahabharata, attributed to Sage Vyasa, is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India. It narrates the story of the Kuru dynasty, focusing on the conflict between the Pandavas and Kauravas. It combines history, mythology, philosophy, dharma (righteousness), and moral lessons.

2. Origins and Genealogy

King Shantanu of Hastinapura married Ganga, and they had Bhishma, a key warrior and celibate protector of the kingdom.

Shantanu later married Satyavati, and they had Chitrangada and Vichitravirya.

Vichitravirya died young; Vyasa fathered Dhritarashtra (blind) and Pandu through the queens Ambika and Ambalika.

Dhritarashtra married Gandhari, having 100 sons called Kauravas, led by Duryodhana.

Pandu married Kunti and Madri, fathering the Pandavas: Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva.

3. Pandavas’ Early Life

Due to a curse, Pandu died early, leaving the Pandavas and Kauravas in the care of Dhritarashtra.

The Pandavas were trained in weapons and statecraft, developing exceptional skills, especially Arjuna in archery.

Duryodhana grew jealous of the Pandavas’ talents and popularity, sowing seeds of conflict.

4. Key Incidents Leading to War

Lakshagraha (House of Lac): Duryodhana tried to kill Pandavas by burning a house made of flammable materials. Pandavas escaped.

Marriage of Draupadi: Arjuna won Draupadi’s hand in her swayamvara. She became the wife of all five Pandavas.

Indraprastha: Pandavas built a magnificent city, provoking further jealousy from Kauravas.

Game of Dice: Yudhishthira lost everything, including his kingdom and Draupadi, in a rigged game, leading to the Pandavas’ exile for 13 years (including 1 year in incognito).

5. Exile and Preparation for War

During exile, Pandavas faced many adventures and learned crucial lessons.

Arjuna gained divine weapons from gods like Shiva and Indra.

Krishna, a cousin of Pandavas and supreme divine guide, became Arjuna’s charioteer and advisor.

6. The Bhagavad Gita

On the battlefield of Kurukshetra, before the war, Arjuna hesitated to fight against his relatives and teachers.

Krishna delivered the Bhagavad Gita, teaching duty (dharma), righteousness, karma, devotion, and self-realization.

Arjuna gained clarity and resolved to fulfill his dharma as a warrior.

8. Aftermath
